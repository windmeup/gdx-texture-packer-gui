psTtGrid = If checked, images are packed in a uniform grid, in order.
psTtScale = For each scale, the images are scaled and an entire atlas is output.
psTtScaleSuffix = For each scale, the suffix to use for the output files. If omitted, files for multiple scales will be output with the same name to a subdirectory for each scale.
